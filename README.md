# shops-backend
Backend of an application that lists shops nearby !!
--> To implement this backend, I chose Spring boot and Api RestFul !! 
--> About the authentication, I will use Spring security !!
--> and for FrontEnd, I will make it by Angular 6 !! Also I'll use google distance matrix api to calculate distance between shops and users current location. 

Until this moment, I've made all the functionalities in backend except the authentication !!

- Everyone can add a shop.
- A user can display the list of nearby shops with liked and disliked shops are excluded !!
- A user can Like a shop, that shop will be displayed in preferred shops !!
- A user can dislike a shop, and that shop will not appear with nearby shops in the next 2 hours.
- A user can display the list of preferred shops too.

All these functionalities are available in backend in this moment.
